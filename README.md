# shoal

**A calm BitTorrent client for your terminal.** Search torrents, download with live
progress, seed, and keep a history — in a fullscreen [Bubble Tea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) UI.

![shoal demo](demo.gif)

Built on a full BitTorrent engine ([anacrolix/torrent](https://github.com/anacrolix/torrent)
— DHT, magnets, web seeds, seeding), with a multi-source search layer and a fullscreen
Bubble Tea UI.

## Install

**Prebuilt binaries (GitHub Releases) — no Go toolchain needed.** Download the archive
for your platform from the [Releases page](https://github.com/StrangeNoob/shoal/releases/latest)
— assets are named `shoal_<version>_<os>_<arch>.tar.gz` (`.zip` on Windows), where `<os>`
is `linux`/`darwin`/`windows` and `<arch>` is `amd64`/`arm64` — unpack it and put the
`shoal` binary on your `PATH`:

```sh
tar -xzf shoal_0.2.0_darwin_arm64.tar.gz     # pick the asset for your OS/arch
sudo mv shoal /usr/local/bin/                # or anywhere on your $PATH
shoal
```

Or with the GitHub CLI (edit the pattern for your OS/arch):

```sh
gh release download --repo StrangeNoob/shoal --pattern 'shoal_*_darwin_arm64.tar.gz'
```

Each release also ships a `checksums.txt` to verify the download.

**Go install** (needs Go 1.24+):

```sh
go install github.com/StrangeNoob/shoal/cmd/shoal@latest
```

This drops a `shoal` binary in your `GOBIN` (`~/go/bin` by default — make sure it's on
your `PATH`). Then just run `shoal`.

**From source** (needs Go 1.24+):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/StrangeNoob/shoal
cd shoal
make install          # go install ./cmd/shoal  → $GOBIN/shoal
# or, to build a local binary without installing:
make build            # → ./shoal
go build -o shoal ./cmd/shoal
```

`go.mod` / `go.sum` are committed, so the build needs no setup step. (`make deps` only
exists to re-pin dependencies.)

Downloads land in `~/Downloads/shoal` by default — change it in **Settings → Save to**.

## Using the TUI

`shoal` opens fullscreen on the **Search** pane. The footer always shows the keys for
the current pane, and `?` opens the full list. `tab` cycles the four panes:
**Search · Downloads · Seeding · Settings**.

**Search**

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/` | focus the search box; type a query and press `enter` |
| `↑ ↓` / `k j` | move the selection |
| `← →` / `h l` | narrow results by media type (All / Movies / TV / Anime / …) |
| `enter` | open the selected result's **details** |
| `d` | download the selected result |
| `S` | sort results (then `← →` pick a column — Size / Seeders / Leechers / Ratio — and `↑ ↓` set direction) |
| `tab` | next pane · `q` / `ctrl+c` quit |

Results stream in live from all sources (`searching… N/M sources`) as a sortable table.
Press `enter` for a **details** screen (size, health, files, hash, magnet) where `d`
downloads, `y` copies the magnet, and `esc` goes back. You can also paste a magnet link
into the search box and press `enter` to add it directly.

**Downloads** — live progress bar, transfer size, peers, and **download speed**. Select
a download with `↑ ↓` and press `x` to **cancel** it (a prompt lets you `k` keep the
partial files or `d` delete them; `esc` aborts).

**Seeding** — completed torrents you're still sharing (ratio, uploaded, **upload speed**),
followed by a **History** of everything you've downloaded (persisted across runs).

**Settings** — theme (Twilight / Tide), color mode, save location, seed ratio, max peers,
listen port. `↑ ↓` move, `← →` change an option, `enter` edits a text field.

Default sources: the Internet Archive, a small open-media catalogue, and public
indexes — FitGirl, YTS, The Pirate Bay, 1337x, EZTV, SolidTorrents, Nyaa, and SubsPlease.

```

The UI depends only on the `source.Source` and `engine.Engine` interfaces, so the engine
can be swapped without touching the UI. The core packages have offline unit tests.

## Development

```sh
make run        # build and launch the TUI
make test       # run the unit tests (offline)
make vet        # go vet
make fmt        # gofmt -w .
make classic    # build the CLI downloader (./shoal-classic)
make help       # all targets
```

## Roadmap

Planned work — contributions welcome:

- **CI/CD (GitHub Actions).** Run `go build`, `go vet`, `gofmt`, and the test suite on
  every push and pull request. The workflow uses `actions/setup-go` with dependency
  caching, so Go modules are downloaded from the proxy once and cached on the runner and
  reused across runs (keyed on `go.sum`) instead of being re-fetched every time.
- **Automated releases.** A tag-triggered workflow (e.g. [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com))
  that cross-compiles static binaries for macOS, Linux, and Windows and publishes them to
  GitHub Releases — so `go install` isn't the only way in.
- **Self-update.** A `shoal update` command (and an in-app prompt) that checks GitHub
  Releases for a newer version and replaces the running binary in place.
- **Pause / resume downloads** and **persist the active download queue** across restarts.
- **More sources** behind the existing `source.Source` interface, each toggleable in Settings.

## A note on use

BitTorrent itself is neutral infrastructure — Linux distributions, game patches, and
large open datasets are all distributed this way. What carries legal risk is the
*content* and the *indexing sites*, not the protocol. shoal can search general torrent
indexes by default; use it only for content you have the right to download and share.
